🆕 📢 ## For a faster way to run ForestFormer3D inference on your own test data, please use the following instruction:
[FF3D_inference – ff3d_forestsens](https://github.com/bxiang233/FF3D_inference/tree/main/ff3d_forestsens)

This version uses 2 inference iterations by default. If your trees are not extremely densely distributed, you can set the number of iterations to 1 instead.

# ForestFormer3D environment setup
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to build and configure the Docker environment for ForestFormer3D, set up debugging in Visual Studio Code, and resolve common issues.

```bash
ForestFormer3D/
├── data/
│   └── ForAINetV2/
│       ├── train_val_data/
│       └── test_data/
├── work_dirs/
│   └── clean_forestformer/
│       └── epoch_3000_fix.pth
```
---

## Steps to build and configure the environment

### **1. Build Docker image**

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd #locationoftheproject#

# Build the Docker image
sudo docker build -t forestformer3d-image .

# Run the Docker container with GPU support, shared memory allocation, and port mapping
sudo docker run --gpus all --shm-size=128g -d -p 127.0.0.1:49211:22 \
  -v #locationofproject#:/workspace \
  -v segmentator:segmentator \
  --name forestformer3d-container forestformer3d-image

# Enter the running container
sudo docker exec -it forestformer3d-container /bin/bash

# Verify required files exist in your container
# ls
# Expected output:
# Dockerfile  configs  data  oneformer3d  readme  replace_mmdetection_files  segmentator  tools  work_dirs
```

### **2. Resolve Torch-Points-Kernels import error**
 
```bash
#test whether you successfully installed torch_points_kernels
python -c "from torch_points_kernels import instance_iou; print('torch-points-kernels loaded successfully')"
```
and if you encounter the following error:

```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch_points_kernels.points_cuda'
```

please try to fix it by:
```bash
# Uninstall the existing torch-points-kernels version
pip uninstall torch-points-kernels -y

# Reinstall the specific compatible version
pip install --no-deps --no-cache-dir torch-points-kernels==0.7.0
```

### **3. Reinstall torch-cluster**
```bash
pip uninstall torch-cluster
pip install torch-cluster --no-cache-dir --no-deps
```

### **4. Replace required files**

```bash
# Find the mmengine package path
pip show mmengine

# Replace the following files with updated versions:
cp replace_mmdetection_files/loops.py /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mmengine/runner/
cp replace_mmdetection_files/base_model.py /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mmengine/model/base_model/
cp replace_mmdetection_files/transforms_3d.py /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mmdet3d/datasets/transforms/
```

### **5. Run the program**

#### **Data preparation**

Ensure the following three folders are set up in your workspace:

- `data/ForAINetV2/meta_data`
- `data/ForAINetV2/test_data`
- `data/ForAINetV2/train_val_data`

- Place all `.ply` files for training and validation in the `train_val_data` folder.
- Place all `.ply` files for testing in the `test_data` folder.

#### **Data preprocessing steps**

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to the data folder
cd data/ForAINetV2

pip install laspy
pip install "laspy[lazrs]"

# Step 2: Run the data loader script
python batch_load_ForAINetV2_data.py
# After this you will have folder data/ForAINetV2/forainetv2_instance_data

# Step 3: Navigate back to the main directory
cd ../..

# Step 4: Create data for training
python tools/create_data_forainetv2.py forainetv2
```

#### **Start training**
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/workspace
# Run the training script with the specified configuration and work directory
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tools/train.py configs/oneformer3d_qs_radius16_qp300_2many.py \
  --work-dir work_dirs/<output_folder_name>
```

#### **Run testing**
##### Use your own trained Checkpoint
```bash
#1. Fix the checkpoint file:
python tools/fix_spconv_checkpoint.py \
  --in-path work_dirs/oneformer3d_1xb4_forainetv2/trained.pth \
  --out-path work_dirs/oneformer3d_1xb4_forainetv2/trained_fix.pth

#2. Modify the output_path in function "predict" in class ForAINetV2OneFormer3D_XAwarequery in file oneformer3d/oneformer3d.py

#3. Run the test script:
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tools/test.py configs/oneformer3d_qs_radius16_qp300_2many.py \
  work_dirs/oneformer3d_1xb4_forainetv2/trained_fix.pth

```
##### Load pre-trained model
```bash
# If you want to use the official pre-trained model, run:
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tools/test.py configs/oneformer3d_qs_radius16_qp300_2many.py work_dirs/clean_forestformer/epoch_3000_fix.pth

```

## Test your own test files

To evaluate your own test files, follow these steps:

### 1. Copy test files

Place your test files under the following directory:

```
data/ForAINetV2/test_data
```

### 2. Update the test list

Edit the following file:

```
data/ForAINetV2/meta_data/test_list.txt
```

Append the base names (without extension) of your test files. For example:

```
your_custom_test_file_name  # <-- add your file name here
```


### 3. Re-run data preprocessing

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to the data folder
cd data/ForAINetV2

# Step 2: Install required libraries (if not already installed)
pip install laspy
pip install "laspy[lazrs]"

# Step 3: Run the data loader script
python batch_load_ForAINetV2_data.py
# This will regenerate data/ForAINetV2/forainetv2_instance_data

# Step 4: Navigate back to the main directory
cd ../..

# Step 5: Create data for training/testing
python tools/create_data_forainetv2.py forainetv2
```

### 4. Run testing script again

Once preprocessing is complete, you can run:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tools/test.py configs/oneformer3d_qs_radius16_qp300_2many.py work_dirs/clean_forestformer/epoch_3000_fix.pth
```

## ⚠️ Using non-ply test files

If your test files are **not in `.ply` format**, you need to modify the data loading logic.

### 1. Update `batch_load_ForAINetV2_data.py`

File path:
```
data/ForAINetV2/batch_load_ForAINetV2_data.py
```

Find the function `export_one_scan()` and modify:

```python
ply_file = osp.join(forainetv2_dir, scan_name + '.ply')
```

to match your test file format, for example:

```python
pc_file = osp.join(forainetv2_dir, scan_name + '.laz')  # or other formats
```

---

### 2. Update `load_forainetv2_data.py` to support new format

File path:
```
data/ForAINetV2/load_forainetv2_data.py
```

Find the function `export()` and modify:

```python
pcd = read_ply(ply_file)
```

If you're using `.laz`, replace with something like:

```python
import laspy

def read_laz(filename):
    las = laspy.read(filename)
    return {
        "x": las.x,
        "y": las.y,
        "z": las.z,
        # Add more fields as needed
    }

pcd = read_laz(ply_file)
```

---

### 3. If test files do not have ground truth labels

Still in `load_forainetv2_data.py`, locate the following lines:

```python
semantic_seg = pcd["semantic_seg"].astype(np.int64)
treeID = pcd["treeID"].astype(np.int64)
```

If the test file lacks these labels, replace them with:

```python
semantic_seg = np.ones((points.shape[0],), dtype=np.int64)
treeID = np.zeros((points.shape[0],), dtype=np.int64)
# semantic_seg = pcd["semantic_seg"].astype(np.int64)
# treeID = pcd["treeID"].astype(np.int64)
```

This will prevent errors when labels are missing in test data.


**Recommendation**: The **easiest solution** is to convert your test files to `.ply` format in advance. This avoids having to change the code and ensures full compatibility with the pipeline.

## **Optional Tips**

#### **Tensorboard Visualization**
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=work_dirs/YOUR_OUTPUT_FOLDER/vis_data/ --host=0.0.0.0 --port=6006
```

#### **Configure SSH for Debugging in Visual Studio Code**
```bash
# Install and start OpenSSH server
apt-get install -y openssh-server
service ssh start

# Set a password for the root user
passwd root

# Modify SSH configuration to enable root login and password authentication
echo -e "PermitRootLogin yes\nPasswordAuthentication yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Restart the SSH service
service ssh restart
```

To connect via SSH in VS Code, ensure you forward port 22 of the container to a host port during docker run. For example, include -p 127.0.0.1:49211:22 in your docker run command.


## 🌲 Handling missed detections in dense test data

In extremely dense test plots, the initial inference run may miss some trees. To address this, we apply ForestFormer3D a second time **only on the remaining points** that were not segmented in the first round.

You can perform this secondary inference by running:

```bash
bash tools/inference_bluepoint.sh
```

This script re-runs inference on remaining "blue points" after the first round.

### 🛠️ How to use

1. Prepare your test data as usual (see earlier sections).
2. Instead of running `tools/test.py`, execute:

```bash
bash tools/inference_bluepoint.sh
```

3. Make the following adjustments before running:

- Put all your test file names in:

```
data/ForAINetV2/meta_data/test_list_initial.txt
```

instead of the default `test_list.txt`.

- Modify `BLUEPOINTS_DIR` in the script to match your output directory (the output_path in function "predict" in class ForAINetV2OneFormer3D_XAwarequery in file workspace/oneformer3d/oneformer3d.py), for example:

```bash
BLUEPOINTS_DIR="$WORK_DIR/work_dirs/YOUROUTPUTPATH"
```

- In the file:
```
oneformer3d/oneformer3d.py
```
Inside the function `predict` of class `ForAINetV2OneFormer3D_XAwarequery`, change:

```python
self.save_ply_withscore(...)
# self.save_bluepoints(...)
```

to:

```python
# self.save_ply_withscore(...)
self.save_bluepoints(...)
```

- Also replace:

```python
# is_test = True
# if is_test:
if 'test' in lidar_path:
```
with the appropriate logic to ensure test mode is active when needed:

```python
is_test = True
if is_test:
#if 'test' in lidar_path:
```

This two-step (or multiple-step) inference improves robustness in challenging, highly dense forests.

## 💡Note on training GPU requirements

The training was run on a single A100 GPU. If you're using a GPU with less memory, try reducing the cylinder radius in the config to prevent OOM.

For inference, batch_size is not used, because each cylinder is processed sequentially. If you encounter CUDA OOM issues during inference, try:

1. Lowering the chunk value in the config

2. Reducing `num_points` in the code ([see this line](https://github.com/SmartForest-no/ForestFormer3D/blob/8ca0f45196ce0cc8a656d046b3f935cbf34f315b/oneformer3d/oneformer3d.py#L2273))

3. Reducing the cylinder radius, which is also configurable in the config file.
